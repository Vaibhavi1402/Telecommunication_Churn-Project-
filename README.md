# Telecommunication_Churn-Project-

Project:
Business Objective: Customer churn is a big problem for telecommunications companies. Indeed, their annual churn rates are usually higher than 10%. For that reason, they develop strategies to keep as many clients as possible. This is a classification project since the variable to be predicted is binary (churn or loyal customer). The goal here is to model churn probability, conditioned on the customer features.
Data Set Details: The data file telecommunications_churn.csv contains a total of 19 features for 3333 customers. Each row corresponds to a client of a telecommunications company for whom it has been collected information about the type of plan they have contracted, the minutes they have talked, or the charge they pay every month.
